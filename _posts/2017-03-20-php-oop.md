<h1>
  OOP in PHP - encapsulation
</h1>

<p>
    Recently I was thinking about OOP and how to use it properly in PHP. I spent hours of reading smart people opinions
    and hours writing my own view of using OOP in PHP. In this <a href="https://github.com/VBoss/PHP-OOP-Example">repository</a>
    are all my thoughts. Data encapsulating is mandatory in true OOP design, you don't want to use raw data. And in this
	article i will show you how to encapsulate data.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>
    Starting
</h2>
<p>
    Goal of this example is to demonstrate how to transform this simplified process of fetching, updating and saving
    to be as OOP as possible. Our source of data is ElasticSearch which returns array of data for entity. In application
    we will change name of entity and add data to nested array. Last step is saving changed entity to elastic as array
    with same structure as entity.
</p>

<h3>
    Original entity Title:
</h3>

```php?start_inline=true 
class Title
{
    private $id;
    private $name;

    public function __construct($data)
    {
        $this->metadata = $data;
    }

    public function getName()
    {
        return $this->metadata['name'];
    }

    public function setName($name)
    {
        $this->metadata['name'] = $name;
    }
}
```

<h3 id="original-app">
    Original application code:
</h3>

```php?start_inline=true 
$data = $this->elastic->get('3315342');

$title = new \Before\Model\Entity\Title($data);

$title->setName('Logan');
$title->setPeople([
    123456 => [
        'id' => 123456,
        'name' => 'Hugh Jackman',
        'character' => 'James Howlett',
    ],
]);

$title->getName();
foreach ($title->getPeople()->getData() as $person) {
    $person->getName();
    $person->getCharacter();
}

$this->elastic->save($entity->toArray());
```

<h3>
    Why is this bad solution
</h3>

<p>
    This is working solution i was using for while but there are issues with maintainability, testing and code consistency.
    Those are things OOP should help with.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        We don't know if entity has valid data. What if we construct with array without 'name' key.
    </li>
    <li>
        Entity does not require configuring all of its properties thus we can have entity without specifying id.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is no validation of data structure for properties. Ie property 'people' has undocumented and complicated
		structure.
    </li>
    <li>
        Tests will be too ambiguous as we can't really know what is input or output data. And in every place in our application
        we have to test if 'getId()' is returning expected value.
    </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2>
    Encapsulating
</h2>

<p>
    To achieve encapsulation we should move all data setting and validation to constructor.
</p>

```php?start_inline=true 
class Title
{
    public function __construct($data)
    {
        if ( ! isset($data['id'])) {
            throw new \InvalidArgumentException();
        }
        if (is_string($data['id'])) {
            throw new \InvalidArgumentException();
        }
        if ($data['id'] < 1) {
            throw new \InvalidArgumentException();
        }
        if ($data['id'] > 9999999) {
            throw new \InvalidArgumentException();
        }

        $this->id = $data['id'];
    }
}
```

<p>
    Now we have valid property id, but entity still has set methods to change its internal properties. So we need to
    duplicate validation to setter right? And what if we need 'id' validation in another object? <strong>Encapsulation</strong>
	is what we need. To avoid duplication of code we can encapsulate data to another class like this.
	<a href="https://github.com/VBoss/PHP-OOP-Example/blob/master/After/Model/Entity/Title/Id.php">source</a>
    And bonus is constructor will be cleaner, more understandable and more maintainable. It won't be too long and it
	won't be doing too much things.
</p>

```php?start_inline=true 
class Id
{
    private $value;

    public function __construct(
        int $id
    )
    {
        if ($data['id'] < 1) {
            throw new \InvalidArgumentException();
        }
        if ($data['id'] > 9999999) {
            throw new \InvalidArgumentException();
        }
        $this->value = $id;
    }

    public function value()
    {
        return $this->value;
    }
}
```

<p>
	Updated title entity:
</p>

```php?start_inline=true
class Title
{
	public function __construct(Id $id)
	{
		$this->id = $id;
	}
}
```

<p>
    Constructing Title entity, keep in mind we are not done here.
</p>

```php?start_inline=true 
$title = new Title(
    new Id($data['id'])
);
```

<p>
    Now we have universal id validating class. We can go deeper as we can encapsulate id value into class 'integerType'
    to validate integer and use that validation in other places. In my <a href="https://github.com/VBoss/PHP-OOP-Example/blob/master/After/Model/Entity/IntegerType.php">example</a>
    I went that far.
</p>
<p>
    But this does not solve problem with setter completely, we can still manipulate Title entity properties during its
    lifetime. That means title entity is not immutable. Making objects immutable is our next step. Best solution is to
	drop setters and don't use them. It is very unlikely to change entity id. But you can
	have another properties which you might want to edit, like <strong>name</strong>. Still setter is not best solution as described
    <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/09/16/getters-and-setters-are-evil.html">many</a> times.
    In this example i have <strong>rename()</strong> function. <a href="https://github.com/VBoss/PHP-OOP-Example/blob/master/After/Model/Entity/Title.php#L76">(source)</a>
    This way entity Title stay valid at all times.
</p>
```php?start_inline=true
public function rename(\After\Model\Entity\Title\Name $name)
{
	$this->name = $name;
}
```

<h2>
    Usages
</h2>
<p>
    Encapsulating, immutability and data validation might not have much sense when you are author of the data and it is
	from your database, but other people <strong>(including future you)</strong> will easily know how to construct entity,
	add/edit data. And desired entity will be valid at all times.
</p>
<p>
    Also this will be really handy if you need to import data to your project from another system, no need for further data
    validation just build entity and you are ready to go.
</p>

<h2>
    Updated example of <a href="#original-app">original</a> application mentioned above. All data are encapsulated,
	validated, and objects are immutable. Changing name is done by dedicated typed function. And save function requires
	interface <strong>IEntity</strong> instead of array. More about transforming entity to array is in my
	<a href="https://github.com/VBoss/PHP-OOP-Example/blob/master/After/Model/ToArray.php">example</a>.
